This packgae implemented the MST parser by Ryan McDonald
It currently can't train models, so you need to import model manually
There is a trained model contained: featureList and featureWeights

Useage:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
perl MSTParser.pl featureList featureWeights test.lab
or
perl MSTParser.pl test.lab (it will use default model)

featureList specify the features used in the trained model

featureWeights specify the weight related to each feature

Input file format:
token1   token2   token3... (the actual words)
POS1   POS2   POS3... (the pos tags, sentence shoud be tagged manually)
LABEL1   LABEL2   LABEL3... (the dependency label, optional, you can leave it blank)
1   3    2... (the dependency parents of current node, optional, just for future reference, you can leave it blank)

Result:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
out.txt

token1   token2   token3... (the actual words)
POS1   POS2   POS3... (the pos tags)
1   3    2... (the dependency parents of current node, generated by the algorithm)
